/* 
Insertion Sort

* Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing
  cards in our hands.
* It is a comparison sort in which the sorted array (or list) is built one entry 
  at a time
* It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as 
  quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort

* In insertion sort, we pick up a particular value and then insert it at the 
  appropriate place in the sorted sub list.

Insertion sort algorithm requires n-1 passes, 

Pass 1: a[1] is inserted either before or after a[0] so that a[0] and a[1] are
        sorted.
Pass 2: a[2] is inserted either before a[0] or between a[0] and a[1] or after
        a[1] so that the elements a[0], a[1], a[2] are sorted.                           
Pass 3: a[3] is inserted either before a[0] or between a[0] and a[1] or between
        a[1] and a[2] or after a[2] so that the elements a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3] 
        are sorted. 
   
Pass k: a[k] is inserted in its proper place in the sorted sub array a[0], a[1],
        a[2],地[k-1] so that the elements a[0], a[1], a[2],地[k-1],a[k] are sorted.           
                                                                                
Pass n-1: a[n-1] is inserted in its proper place in the sorted sub array a[0],
          a[1], a[2],地[n-2] so that the elements a[0], a[1], a[2],地[n-1] are 
          sorted.
