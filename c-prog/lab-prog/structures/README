declaration 
- struct is a keyword ,
- Struct_type is a name (tag) that identifies structures of this composition 
- member_type1 member_name1, member_type2, memeber_name2... are individual member declaration.

struct key facts
- The individual members can be ordinary variables ,pointers, arrays, or other structures. 
- The member names within a particular structure must be distinct from one another ,though a member name can be
the same as the name of a variable defined outside the structure.
- A storage class cannot be assigned to an individual member, 
- and individual members cannot be initialized within a structure type declaration .
- unlike the declaration of a variable of array ,defining a structure causes no storage to be reserved.


By defining a structure ,the programmers derives a new data type composed of a collection of already
known data types and their names. For example ,suppose that the information about 10,000 business
accounts has to be maintained .The information consist of mixed data types, where for each account the
following are required.
  account number (int)
  account type   (short)
  name           (30 char array)
  street address (100 char array)
  city/state/zip (30 char array)
  balance        (long)
  last payment   (long)
  date           (short)

Each account will have one structure defined as follows:
struct account
{
   int acct_no;
   short acct_type;
   char name[30];
   char street[30];
   char city_state[30];
   long balance;
   long last_payment;
};


Referencing structure members

dot operator is a member of highest precedence group ,and it’s associativity if from left to right.
dot operators takes the precedence over the unary operators as well as the various arithmetic relational ,logical and assignments operators.


Expression Interpretation
++customer.balance
customer.balance—
&customer
&customer.acct_no increment the value of customer.balance.
increment the value of customer.balance after accessing its value
accessing the beginning address of customer.
accessing the beginning address of customer.acct_no.
